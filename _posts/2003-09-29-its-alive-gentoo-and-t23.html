	<p>So <a href="http://ebullient.haaser.com/archives/000133.php#comments">this comment</a> on the first of my entries about Gentoo on a T23 reminded me to make an update regarding my now working system</p>

	<p>I also sorted out my <a href="http://ebullient.haaser.com/archives/000139.php"><span class="caps">VMW</span>are issues</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Kernel Configuration</strong></p>

	<p>Here is my <a href="/files/config-2.4.20-gentoo-r7.txt" title="config-2.4.20-gentoo-r7">working kernel configuration</a></p>

	<p>Significant points:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="caps">APM</span> compiled in</li>
		<li><span class="caps">ACPI</span> y, with sub-items as modules</li>
		<li><span class="caps">PCMCIA</span>/Cardbus support compiled in  (emerged pcmcia-cs with cardbus disabled)</li>
		<li><span class="caps">IPSEC</span> as a module</li>
		<li>Only the <span class="caps">EEPRO</span> module for <span class="caps">PCI</span> network support</li>
		<li>Wireless <span class="caps">PCI</span> and Wireless <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> and network <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> support in modules</li>
		<li>Only Sound support and <span class="caps">OSS</span> sound support, both as modules. Emerged alsa-driver for sound support.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">VMW</span>are configuration</strong></p>

	<p>This kind of sorted itself out.  I spoke to a co-worker, and he said he hadn&#8217;t had to do anything funny to get <span class="caps">VMW</span>are to stop complaining. So, I deleted /etc/devfs.d/vmware (a file I&#8217;d created to recreate the devfs link for vmmon), I removed vmnet and vmmon from /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4 (I&#8217;d tried a few variations with the two modules here.. ). </p>

	<p>I&#8217;d forgotten tweaking the <span class="caps">VMW</span>are start-up script to load the vmmon and vmnet modules. When I upgraded the <span class="caps">VMW</span>are-workstation ebuild (because of some minor change), etc-update reminded me, and I scrapped those changes to.  For some reason, with absolutely no intervention on my part, <span class="caps">VMW</span>are now remains configured on it&#8217;s own. </p>

	<p>I probably thought it was having trouble because I was recompiling the kernel between reboots, something extremely unusual for me to do, but something that would cause the vmware modules to complain when they were loaded.</p>

	<p>Everything is smashing, now!</p>
