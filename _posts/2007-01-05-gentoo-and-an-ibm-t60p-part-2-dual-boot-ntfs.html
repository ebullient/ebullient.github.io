	<p>I have what I tried below, but I eventually dropped the attempt. The Lenovo modules hung up <span class="caps">VMW</span>are any time I tried to boot it that way, and while I could mount the <span class="caps">NTFS</span> partition used by WinXP R/W with the tools below, I could not easily get WinXP to look at the lion&#8217;s share of the drive. (My fault, really &#8211; if I weren&#8217;t so attached to other filesystem types, I could probably have made this work).</p>

	<h3>Dual Boot</h3>

	<p>My new-fangled laptop comes with XP Pro, and I don&#8217;t have disks for re-installing that OS from scratch (in <span class="caps">VMW</span>are, for example). So, as an experiment, I decided to resize the WinXP partition, and put gentoo on the lion&#8217;s share of the drive. I want to see if I can get a dual-boot OR <span class="caps">VMW</span>are image running off of that same base &#8211; because I think that would be cool<sup id="fnrev7048958234fd685f22dbf8" class="footnote"><a href="#fn7048958234fd685f22dbf8">1</a></sup>. File access would be interesting &#8211; but that&#8217;s another story; I want to see if it will work, first. As part of that effort, I also added support for R/W <span class="caps">NTFS</span><sup id="fnrev422670574fd685f22dc27" class="footnote"><a href="#fn422670574fd685f22dc27">2</a></sup>.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>sys-fs/ntfsprogs-1.13.1</li>
	</ul>

	<p>While poking around, I read up on <span class="caps">NTFS</span><sup id="fnrev21372720164fd685f22e6a2" class="footnote"><a href="#fn21372720164fd685f22e6a2">3</a></sup> &#8211; and I think, based on the interoperability section, that I&#8217;ll also look into ntfs-3g. Note that this requires the freshest version of fuse, which means: don&#8217;t compile <span class="caps">CONFIG</span>_FUSE_FS into your kernel. Either compile it as a module, or leave it out entirely.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>sys-fs/fuse-2.6.0</li>
		<li>sys-fs/ntfs3g-0.20061115-r1</li>
	</ul>
