<p>I have, in fact, begun publishing my scans on <a href="http://silverpuddle.deviantart.com/">deviantArt</a>.. I told you I wanted to get prints of some of them.. ;)</p>

<p>The scanning has only just begun, though, so be patient. Some of these  images have spent too long in a sketchbook rubbing against other pages.. so it's hard to get the scan so it doesn't look so darn grainy. *sigh*</p>
