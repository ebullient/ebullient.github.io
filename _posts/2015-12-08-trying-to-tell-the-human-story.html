	<p>Writing is always hard. Writing technical stuff is hard. Writing technical stuff that doesn&#8217;t sound like it is a regurgitated text book&#8230; <strong>sigh</strong></p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been leading a team working on or with Microservices at <span class="caps">IBM</span> (lots of people everywhere are doing things with microservices, this should come as no surprise). We&#8217;ve been specifically looking at how to modernize an existing Java EE application. There are articles about this, but they are all formal, and (to me) preachy.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;re doing the experiment live, so to speak. Taking the crufty Plants By WebSphere application and pulling it apart bit by bit. Our aim is to make sure you have a functional application at all times, and to frankly just share our thoughts as we try it. Let us know what you think.</p>
