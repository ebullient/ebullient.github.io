Yes, I confess, I did .. umm.. censor my blogs over the years. When facebook arrived, blog posts about nasty headaches and reactions to the latest headlines could all go away. The exodus of content continued with the advent of Twitter. Which left this blog, which I've tended on and off for close to 14 years, in the lurch!

There is also the small matter of how much time I have left to spend on blog posts between work, kids, and this mammoth garden we have going in the back yard. The mammoth garden is totally my fault, we started it as an excuse to get _me_ out of the house. It worked.

However, it has become obvious that a return to blogging is overdue. To start with, Game On! needed a blog! We kept having little tidbits to share, with nowhere to  have that live. I made an initial foray into creating a blog with Jekyll to build a [new blog for Game On!](http://blog.gameontext.org). I kind of liked how that worked, AND it meant I could stop having to edit posts via the web, which I also like.

## Jekyll

It took me a few tries (divided attention #FTW!), but I realized that after messing with blogs for over 10 years, I've seen all the things. Way back in the beginning was Movable Type (which I didn't realize was still a thing), followed by PHP-based CMS like Textpattern and Nucleus CMS, and then a brief flirtation with Blogger (someone made me do it). I have somehow avoided ever having to maintain templates for WordPress (?!). These systems all come back to some pretty basic concepts around templating.

The hardest bit was loathing having to do anything with ruby. I have never had anything but grief and pain from installing ruby anywhere. But hey! We have docker now! Put it in a container and forget about it. WOOT!

Docker files for running jekyll without hurting yourself:
* [docker-compose.yml]({{ '/files/2017-04-jekyll/docker-compose.yml' | relative_url }})
* [Dockerfile]({{ '/files/2017-04-jekyll/Dockerfile' | relative_url }})

I had to cheat a little bit (but only a little), because you have a chicken and egg problem if you're creating a Jekyll blog from scratch. You can use the source docker image for that, per [Jekyll Docker Usage: Running](https://github.com/jekyll/docker/wiki/Usage:-Running):

  * Create a new jekyll site:
    ```
    docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll   -it -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:pages jekyll new .
    ```

  * Serve content:
    ```
    docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll \
  -it -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
    ```

You get the idea. The `docker-compose.yml` file makes it easy to set up the container with the mounted volume without thinking about it. Then edit away, and watch your blog rebuild. Not too shabby.

## Templates with Flexbox (CSS)

I browsed through a bunch of templates, and decided pretty early that they were all more complicated than I thought was necessary. The most significant non-standard thing for the Game On! blog is that there are multiple authors, and that those authors must be described in a certain way to make the generated atom/RSS feed happy (yes, I looked).

I went back to basics and built the templates up from scratch. I used flexbox, both on the Game On! blog and on my own, for a nice, fluid, responsive UI with minimal HTML (because really, who wants to maintain all those crap filler tags anyway? You're right, not me). There was a lot of cutting and pasting as there are only so many ways to write a [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) template to show an index of all Jekyll posts, but in the end, a lot was left on the cutting room floor.

## Dealing with Tags (and no plugins)

I like tag indexes, as I use tags a lot. There are a few posts about how to manage a tag index with jekyll and no plugins (important if you're hosting on github, which I am). Some of them require interesting manual update steps to create individual files per tag, which I think is pretty ick to maintain. At least one Atom plugin aims to help with maintaining files for tags, but.. meh. Maybe someday.

For right now, I cheated / went low-tech. You get one page that indexes the posts by tag (where the post might be on there multiple times, but whatever).

## The result

Well, you're looking at it! One thing sacrificed on my blog is a twitter feed (at least for the moment). I'm not sure I care all that much. My twitter feed has been taken over by politics anyway.

## Blog behavior crossed with DNS: what's in a name?

One thing I enjoyed stumbling was a [blog post from netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/) discussing whether you should, or shouldn't be running your blog from the apex domain. I confess they changed my mind, and now my blog is here running at [http://www.ebullientworks.com/](http://www.ebullientworks.com/)!
