We shall see how this goes over time, but so far? Oh hell yes.

I am experimenting with a cute little app (I have, sad to say, fallen head over feet into the Apple ecosystem. Other devices might seem cool, but not worth the gymnastics. Ecosystem stickiness is a thing.) that allows me to edit. code. from. my. iPad. 

Why would I want to do that?

* Device junky that I am, I totes splurged and got an iPad Pro, with its little keyboard.
* I would really really really like to make more entries to this blog, for example. This is a nice alternative to hauling laptop around.
* I want to see how far I can push this über tiny device thing, that ALSO happens to have a stylus (yes, I am one of those people that thinks better long-hand).

So exciting! 

The one challenge with this, in particular, is that I can’t get the Jekyll preview that I could if I were running locally. The iPad Pro is quite the workhorse... but it doesn’t (yet, ha!) run Docker containers.

Oh, right. The app: [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com). It also integrates with [iOctocat](https://ioctocat.com).
