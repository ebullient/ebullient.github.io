I spent an excellent few hours recording a podcast with Adam Bien. 

CORBA? OpenLiberty? Robots? The glory days of object marshaling? Such a trip down memory lane! We could easily have talked for another hour.

Can you hear my rings clinking on my favorite mug? Yes, yes you can. 

Give it a listen: [Java EE ebullience](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/airhacks.fm/airhacksfm_3.mp3).
