I offered to be a DM for my son and his friends because of their creativity, and trying to preserve their ability to "pretend" before the pressures of growing up could convey to them that it was uncool. I made the offer to my son before being aware of Critical Role, without ever having watched Stranger Things. To fall headfirst into a hobby as it was experiencing something of a reneissance was a happy accident.

Crossing my need to know all the things about D&D with a conference talk, that's pretty normal. The emerging talk was born for [SpringOne in 2019]({% post_url 2019-10-23-springone-monsters-metrics %}). It had a significant revision for DevNexus in early 2020.

I was asked, based solely on the abstract for the DevNexus talk, if I would be interested in writing an article on the topic. I agreed. The resulting article was published in German, in the September 2020 issue of [Java Magazin](https://kiosk.entwickler.de/java-magazin/java-magazin-9-2020/dungeons-dragons/), with "Dungeons and Dragons" as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.

The English version has also now been published at [JaxEnter](https://jaxenter.com/metrics-dnd-173311.html), "Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&D". I hope you enjoy it.
