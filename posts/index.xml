Some day I will have to do a proper write-up of how I&amp;rsquo;m using it to organize my brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The TL;DR version is that I had a mental log-jam in March, when the kids finished their first D&amp;amp;D campaign while I was also in the middle of starting some new things for the day job. I made a vault for D&amp;amp;D, and dumped &lt;em>ALL&lt;/em> of the stuff there (removing it from the scattering of notes I had in places, and netting out all the relationships I kind of had just lying around in my head). I made another vault for the rest of what is in my brain, and that is proceeding at a slower pace.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One thing lead to another, and time passed, and I worked on the Quarkus CLI, and then I had the idea to write my own client that could do all of the steps required (validate the xml, merge/combine/filter with XSLT) and additionally convert the output into markdown.&lt;/p>

I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of Java Magazin, with &amp;ldquo;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.
The English version was first published at JAXenter as &amp;ldquo;Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo;.
I hope you enjoy it.

I treat them as my extended memory. Blog posts used to do this,
but life and children have eaten up the capacity I used to have for writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I thought I would share my latest script for the lazy (which I have now duplicated several times. I know, I know. WET, DRY. I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered). This script iterates over all of the git repositories in a sub-directory (where I have several related ones), fetches everything, fast-forwards if it can, and otherwise tries to rebase on the upstream branch if there is one that matches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is an extra case statement at the bottom as I inevitably extend this to do
more things specific to this group of projects. This kind of approach grew out
of the scripts written for Game On!, which still work well, and do their extra
duty reminding me what on earth I was doing the last time I worked on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SpringOne 2019: Monsters and Metrics</title><link>/2019/10/23/springone-monsters-metrics.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/10/23/springone-monsters-metrics.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Two things collided in my brain this year ahead of SpringOne: Preparing a new talk from scratch covering the Micrometer (and the related Spring implementation), and learning everything I needed to know to be a Dungeon Master for my 10-year-old son and his friends.&lt;/p>

Modern Cloud Native applications are not composed of a single language, or runtime. There are often local standards and requirements for individual services, intended to allow the application as a whole to be properly managed, and secure. In this talk, Erin and Ozzy will discuss what it means to be a Spring application in a polyglot environment, with a focus on interoperable security, logging, metrics, and including a brief boat trip to view the architectural considerations for a Spring Cloud application on Kubernetes.
This session has its root in some work Ozzy and I did with one of our customers.</description></item><item><title>Code @ IBM Think 2019: Cloud-Native Security for Java</title><link>/2019/02/16/ibm-think-cloud-native-security.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/02/16/ibm-think-cloud-native-security.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Billy and I put together a tidy little talk about Cloud-Native

I can&amp;rsquo;t make conference materials with a straight-face when left to my own devices, I just can&amp;rsquo;t!
Reactive paradigms can be confusing, so Ozzy and I put this workshop together.
First, we give an overview of reactive operators. Using the Jabberwocky as input, we present participants with problems to solve.
First with RxJava, then with Spring WebFlux, and finally with Akka.
It was fun. ;)

I am experimenting with a cute little app (I have, sad to say, fallen head over feet into the Apple ecosystem. Other devices might seem cool, but not worth the gymnastics. Ecosystem stickiness is a thing.) that allows me to edit. code. from. my. iPad.
Why would I want to do that?
Device junky that I am, I totes splurged and got an iPad Pro, with its little keyboard. I would really really really like to make more entries to this blog, for example. This is a nice alternative to hauling laptop around. I want to see how far I can push this über tiny device thing, that ALSO happens to have a stylus (yes, I am one of those people that thinks better long-hand). So exciting!
The one challenge with this, in particular, is that I can’t get the Jekyll preview that I could if I were running locally. The iPad Pro is quite the workhorse&amp;hellip; but it doesn’t (yet, ha!) run Docker containers.
Oh, right. The app: Working Copy. It also integrates with iOctocat.</description></item><item><title>JavaOne 2017: Introduction to Reactive Systems</title><link>/2017/10/05/javaone-introduction-to-reactive-systems.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/10/05/javaone-introduction-to-reactive-systems.html</guid><description>A Joint adventure with Lightbend, we lead folks in the workshop through a specialized version of our Game On! Text Adventure..
IBM and Lightbend are teaming up to introduce you to developing reactive microservices on Kubernetes. Lagom is a microservice framework built atop Lightbend’s tried-and-proven distributed systems toolkit, Akka. This framework helps you build microservices as systems—reactive systems, to be precise—so that your microservices are elastic and resilient by nature. The reactive programming model aims to ensure systems availability and performance while processing streaming data. You will use Lagom’s development environment to avoid tedious setup and scripting when developing locally and will deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster, so others in the workshop (and at JavaOne) can test out what you built.

Way back in the beginning was Movable Type (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was still a thing), followed by PHP-based CMS like Textpattern and Nucleus CMS, and then a brief flirtation with Blogger (someone made me do it). I have somehow avoided ever having to maintain templates for WordPress (?!). These systems all come back to some pretty basic concepts around templating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one snag was loathing having to do anything with ruby. I have never had anything but grief and pain installing ruby anywhere. But hey! We have docker now!

When facebook arrived, blog posts about nasty headaches and reactions to the latest headlines could all go away. The exodus of content continued with the advent of Twitter. Which left this blog, which I&amp;rsquo;ve tended on and off for close to 14 years, in the lurch!
There is also the small matter of how much time I have to spend on blog posts between work, kids, and this mammoth garden we have going in the back yard. The mammoth garden is totally my fault, we started it as an excuse to get me outside. It worked.
However, it has become obvious that a return to blogging is overdue. To start with, Game On! needed a blog! We kept having little tidbits to share, that needed a home. I made an initial foray into creating a blog with Jekyll to build a new blog for Game On!. I kind of liked how that worked, AND it meant I could stop having to edit posts via the web, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve now brought that to my own blog, too.
Next post: the jekyll stuff.</description></item><item><title>IBM InterConnect 2017: Microservices, Twelve Factors, Security</title><link>/2017/03/28/ibm-interconnect-microservices-12-factors-security.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2017/03/28/ibm-interconnect-microservices-12-factors-security.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots to talk about this year.

Given the breadth of technologies related to the term, it can be difficult to get a full picture of what a microservices architecture should look like, or to understand why it is said that microservices architectures both remove and introduce complexity at the same time. Game On! Text Adventure is a throwback text-based adventure built to help you explore microservices concepts.
There are lots of examples of microservices that go something like: type in this code, run this build, push this button, and then poof! you have your service! Others show how to install and configure a multi-process component like etcd or consul. They even sometimes describe how to then add a service to it, and maybe even sometimes how to find the added service. But, in a lot of ways, it all seems out of context. From those examples, I only got a glimpse of one piece at a time. I never got an understanding of how an application built using a collection of interacting microservices really worked.
The premise of Game On! is simple: we provide some core elements and then you create services (one or many) to extend the world. It provides a choose-your-own-adventure approach to learning about microservices. We have walk-throughs that do what many other examples do: follow some steps, push some buttons, and TA-DA! you have a working single service written in Java, JavaScript, or Go.
A difference, however, is that your shiny new service is registered as a part of a larger system right out of the gate. The APIs that your service implements will be called by elements of the long-running composed application. How you choose to play with the next steps (making the service resilient, load-balancing and scaling, dealing with eventual consistency) becomes something that can be explored without having to implement a whole bunch of pieces yourself.
More walk-throughs will be coming over time, with most building on the basic walk-throughs we have now.All of the source is available on GitHub. We hope you enjoy working with it as much as we enjoyed building it.</description></item><item><title>IBM InterConnect 2016: Microservices, Monoliths, and Async EE7</title><link>/2016/02/26/ibm-interconnect-monoliths-microservices-ee7.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/02/26/ibm-interconnect-monoliths-microservices-ee7.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots to talk about this year!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We started with a best-guess set of services, and over time, it became pretty apparent that our first pass at a map building service (the Concierge) was both misleading in purpose and insufficient in function.

I've been leading a team working on or with Microservices at IBM (lots of people everywhere are doing things with microservices, this should come as no surprise). We've been specifically looking at how to modernize an existing Java EE application. There are articles about this, but they are all formal, and (to me) preachy.
We're doing the experiment live, so to speak. Taking the crufty Plants By WebSphere application and pulling it apart bit by bit. Our aim is to make sure you have a functional application at all times, and to frankly just share our thoughts as we try it.

I believe these two things are true:
it is very important to secure your microservices it can be difficult to read documentation trying to explain how to secure your microservices We’ve built three samples for you, which we hope will be easy to read, and will teach you something new.
Using API keys to secure your microservice is Adam’s sample. He explains what API keys are, where they come from, and how they’re used. The sample code is available on github.
Using access tokens to secure microservices is the first of two from Ozzy. He explains how the access tokens created as a result of working with OAuth and OpenID Connect work and are used within a microservices architecture.
Using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to secure microservices builds on the previous article to explain how to use Signed JWTs to propagate identity instead of access tokens.

Some of this content is old, but the gist is still useful.
Microservice architectures are highly distributed, with services provided by individual processes that are scaled independently. Understanding and maintaining overall system health becomes increasingly difficult as the system grows; it becomes impractical to look at services instance-by-instance. Monitoring systems like nagios help, but what happens when things go wrong? It is not always possible (much less easy) to ssh into any given system. In some environments the filesystem used by any given instance is transient; when the process stops, the filesystem is cleaned up, including all the logs!
The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a commonly used system for gathering data (both logs and metrics), and allowing that data to be aggregated, analyzed, visualized, and searched in useful ways.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on getting the most out of WAS Liberty logs using logstash. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way: the IBM WebSphere Liberty buildpack in Bluemix, for example, uses loggregator (Cloud Foundry) rather than logstash. But I do hope that this gives you some ideas for how to make the logging capabilities in WAS Liberty work for your environment.
Getting useful information to system streams When operating on its own, WAS Liberty produces a few different log files by default:
&amp;ldquo;console&amp;rdquo; output is lightly formatted and contains no timestamps. Failure/error messages and System.err are routed to STDERR, while other important messages and System.out, are routed to STDOUT. When run in the background via server start, both streams are collected into a console.log file. messages.log also collects System out, System err, as well as a larger subset of messages (including INFO). trace.log only appears if detailed trace is enabled. It includes output from all enabled log sources, including System.out and System.err. Having log messages go directly to STDOUT and/or STDERR is a good environment-agnostic practice for microservices (and is also one of the 12-factors). It is a pretty simple change to get formatted Liberty logs writing to STDOUT. To ensure we don&amp;rsquo;t miss any messages from server bootstrap and startup, we&amp;rsquo;ll do this via a bootstrap.properties file that contains:
# Write WLP logs to stdout directly com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.file.name=stdout As you might infer, this re-routes what would go to trace.log to STDOUT. Before this change, STDOUT when running Liberty looks something like this:
1$ wlp/bin/server run 2Launching defaultServer (WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.6/wlp-1.0.9.cl50620150610-1749) on Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, version 1.7.0_72-b14 (en_US) 3[AUDIT ] CWWKE0001I: The server defaultServer has been launched. Afterwards, it looks more like (notice the leading timestamp and fixed fields):
1$ wlp/bin/server run 2Launching defaultServer (WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.6/wlp-1.0.9.cl50620150610-1749) on Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, version 1.7.0_72-b14 (en_US) 3[8/25/15 12:40:44:479 EDT] 00000001 id= com.ibm.ws.kernel.launch.internal.FrameworkManager A CWWKE0001I: The server defaultServer has been launched. In some cases, this might be enough. If you&amp;rsquo;re running Liberty in the foreground in a Docker container, Liberty&amp;rsquo;s formatted log entries would now be spilling out as the Docker container&amp;rsquo;s STDOUT. If the hosting environment does post-processing on that output, you may have nothing left to do.
Using logstash to post-process logs However, we can use logstash to process Liberty log output to produce more robust events. How you link logstash and Liberty together will depend on how and where Liberty is running. As a bare minimum useful for testing filters, you can try something like the following:
1$ wlp/bin/server run | logstash -f /path/to/logstash.conf You can use the -e command line option to define your filters inline, but I&amp;rsquo;m starting with the configuration file up front because I&amp;rsquo;ll spend the rest of the post adding things to it.
Changing the output / making sure it works I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the log-processing equivalent of &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Edit your logstash.conf file to contain:
input { stdin { } } output { stdout { } } You get back pretty much exactly what you had before (with a leading message about logstash startup being complete and additional leading logstash timestamps):
1$ wlp/bin/server run | logstash -f logstash.conf 2Logstash startup completed 32015-08-26T22:23:04.587Z ec2db0f13b8f Launching defaultServer (WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.6/wlp-1.0.9.cl50620150610-1749) on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, version 1.8.0_45-internal-b14 (en) 42015-08-26T22:23:04.588Z ec2db0f13b8f [8/26/15 22:22:45:918 UTC] 00000001 id= com.ibm.ws.kernel.launch.internal.FrameworkManager A CWWKE0001I: The server defaultServer has been launched. This does increase the amount of time it takes before we can see that the server has started properly, as the messages piped through logstash get delayed a bit while logstash starts itself.
Debugging Given we&amp;rsquo;re going to start doing crazy things, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to be able to see how we changed what logstash stores for each entry. We&amp;rsquo;ll use the rubydebug codec to do this:
output { stdout { codec =&amp;gt; rubydebug } ... } Once we add that, those first few lines now look like this (please do scroll right):
Handle multiple lines We&amp;rsquo;re going to start adding filters in the next few sections. The first we will add is for multi-line output.
input { ... } filter { # Combine lines that do not start with &amp;quot;[&amp;quot; or # contain &amp;quot;WebSphere Application Server&amp;quot; with the previous message multiline { pattern =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;(^[)|(WebSphere Application Server)&amp;quot; negate =&amp;gt; true what =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;previous&amp;quot; } ## MORE HERE. } output { ... } Note first that the pattern is negated; we&amp;rsquo;re asserting that any line that does not match the pattern is a continuation, and should be lumped together with the previous line.
Liberty log entries (and even wrapped System.out or System.err output) all start with a bracketed timestamp that looks something like, [8/26/15 22:22:45:918 UTC]. But, remember that first line of Liberty trace? &amp;ldquo;Launching defaultServer (WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.6/wlp-1.0.9.cl50620150610-1749)&amp;rdquo;. Since this is the very first line of output, we have to account for it as a standalone line (go ahead and take it out if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me&amp;hellip; ).
Without logstash (just using raw Liberty), you might see the following output if you use an include to reconfigure your httpEndpoint. Note that the Liberty log timestamp is only on the first line, as this is a multi-line entry that is (further) not a stack trace:</description></item><item><title>Docker script for AnyConnect on OSX</title><link>/2015/08/25/docker-script-for-anyconnect-on-osx.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/25/docker-script-for-anyconnect-on-osx.html</guid><description>I am queen of laziness, and I have to use AnyConnect, and that screws with Docker, and then I have to go looking to remember the magic incantation to get things right...

Play with Async EE7 instead</title><link>/2015/08/21/don-t-wait-build-responsive-applications-with-java-ee-7-instead.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/21/don-t-wait-build-responsive-applications-with-java-ee-7-instead.html</guid><description> Note: Originally posted on IBM DeveloperWorks. Some of this content is old, but the gist is still useful.
Java EE 7 introduced additional support for asynchronous request processing over and above the asynchronous servlets and EJBs that were provided in Java EE 6. Java EE 7 includes support for WebSockets, non-blocking I/O in Servlet 3.1, asynchronous processing in JAX-RS 2.0, and Concurrency Utilities for container-supported multi-threading. All of these capabilities have a role to play in making new flavors of applications and application architectures more responsive and efficient.
Responsive applications to improve the user experience Consider single page applications (SPA). JavaScript is loaded and run on the client-side as a long-running process (for as long as that browser window/tab, or mobile phone application is active). If you’ve used Gmail or Facebook, or have done some shopping at Amazon, you know what an SPA looks and feels like. When working with an SPA, the user no longer experiences a full page refresh: event-driven, partial page updates are the norm in this environment.
An SPA client generates multiple separate requests to the back-end server to populate different areas of the page. From a user experience point of view, this is great! No blank pages of doom! No tapping of fingers waiting for something to load before you give up and go do something else. Things are a little different when looking at what happens to the supporting infrastructure.
Handling connections to responsive applications If the application happens to have frequent updates with small payloads, connection management can become a real problem. The metadata for the HTTP request alone can dwarf the size of the payload it needs to carry, never mind the cost of establishing connections, dealing with proxies, or performing SSL handshakes. There are some connection management tricks that can be played to reduce the overhead, but there is a trade-off in complexity, especially if you want data to be able to flow both ways.
Using WebSockets upgrades an established HTTP connection into a persistent connection that allows for efficient two-way communication between the client and the server. This eliminates the overhead and complexity of managing multiple connections to achieve the same end. Chat applications everywhere, rejoice!
What happens if the application is running on an under-powered client, or on a client on a slow network? Non-blocking I/O support introduced in Servlet 3.1 allows the server-side application to define handlers that can be used to read or write the next chunk of data when the opposite end of the connection is finally ready to provide or receive it. In the meanwhile, the server-side application can happily be handling other requests.
Asynchronous support in JAX-RS 2.0 What I think will get the most attention and use is async support in JAX-RS 2.0, mostly because HTTP/REST is such a commonly used protocol. Using the @Suspended annotation allows the association between the inbound connection and the request-processing thread to be broken (suspended). That association can then be resumed later to send the response. When combined with either Asynchronous EJBs (of the lite variety) or Concurrency Utilities (to help with context propagation), there is a lot more flexibility with how work is processed on the server-side.
I put together a collection of samples to show what these technologies look like in use. They are small and simple and have their origins in my IBM Interconnect session from February 2015. They are progressive in nature, beginning usually with the pre-Java EE 7 status quo, and then stepping through using the technology and, in some cases, showing some alternate usage patterns.
I hope you find them useful, feedback is welcome!

Some of this content is old, but the gist is still useful.
The microservices approach for building (or decomposing) complex applications has received a lot of attention because it can bring so many benefits. Small teams work independently on different parts of the application, moving their standalone piece from development to production at their own pace via a devOps/self-service deployment infrastructure.
The key to this application structure is what each piece, each service, does. The phrase “high cohesion and low coupling” strongly applies: each service should do/own/manage whatever is necessary to provide a useful function. Services in this model are not necessarily small, but they are self-contained and can be updated independently.
Microservices applications are built and oriented around decoupled, independent services. This approach is a specific variant of SOA, one that eschews mediating ESBs in favor of smart endpoints that make their own decisions about how to interact with target services.
These independent services are managed in a significantly different way than traditional enterprise applications. Services are made available via collections of individual, transient service instances. The number of instances will vary based on load.
Service upgrades are performed via blue/green (or red/black) deployments: new versions are deployed side-by-side with old versions, with old versions gradually being removed as clients of the service begin using the new version. This is a rip-and-replace upgrade process, where deployed services are replaced with a newer version rather than migrated.
Given all of this, are there best practices for creating microservices? The Twelve-factor application methodology is one frequently referenced approach. It defines factors that services should follow to build portable, resilient applications for cloud environments (SaaS). To quote, 12-factor applications:
Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project; Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments; Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration; Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility; And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
All of the 12 factors can be satisfied by a Java EE 7 application running on WAS Liberty: some factors are specific to how the application is built, some are based on how the supporting server is configured, and some are aspects of the surrounding environment.

The real bugger is that fluxbox keeps crashing. I have gnome running (session manager, session prefs, etc.), but am using fluxbox as a window manager. I'm sorry.. all the compiz stuff looks cool, but once you start stacking/grouping windows, it's really hard to get used to a window manager that won't do it. I had fluxbox working as the window manager with Lucid (10.04) without issue, but for some reason, flux crashes a _lot_ with 10.10. Pain.

So: the goal is a DNS-323 with all of our files (photos, music, finance stuff, some movies, etc.) onto the first volume of that drive, and then using an rsync shadow with hardlinks to do nightly backups to the second drive. Some RAID configurations have been reported as less than stable, and using a mirror configuration requires both drives to be active: a nightly rsync backup will do.

Chris was very careful that I not see anything about it (I also was honest and didn't go looking.. I mean, what's the fun of that?), but he has asked me to guess what it was.. "A spare tire", "A wall-hanging jewelry closet", "A mirror"...

There are a few of them I've been lugging along in my silly sketchbook, and I really like them.. which actually makes me less likely to carry the thing along, because it could mess up some of those doodles I really like.
So. I started by *gasp* removing them all from my little sketch book. I happen (because I'm a dork) to be equipped with things to make a nice portfolio with these sketches in them because of other crafty things, so I know where they'll end up. BUT.. before they go there, I'd like to get some high-quality scans of them (I'd like to be able to make prints of at least one..).
Anyway, after wasting scads of time, I can agree that the following links have whatchya need: Scanning pencil drawings (question in forum thread) Extending dynamic range (resulting HOW-TO)
I've been going back and forth between the two plugins mentioned in the posts above, and I'm also hovering between the two methods (two gimp plugins: dynamic range extender (DRE) or HDR tone mapping). As I go, I have been slowly leaning towards the first (which is what the author used for the example in the HOW-TO), mostly because I can then scan and work with the image all in grayscale (the HDR plugin assumes RGB mode). Not sure which is better in the end, but I'm finding the output from the DRE plugin to be more direct.
Scan w/ XSane: Standard options window: Brightness (1, 0, -2 or -3), Sharpness 1 Created a "pencil sketch" medium: Gray with 1.0 Gamma, and -100/100 brightness/contrast (basically telling the xsane post-scanning processor to leave it alone)</description></item><item><title>Emergency brain</title><link>/2007/03/30/emergency-brain.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2007/03/30/emergency-brain.html</guid><description>Thank goodness I have a functioning emergency brain.

&lt;p>This was happening to me, and while that's a lindows tutorial, it hit the nail on the head:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>Because devfs rebuilds the /dev tree at each reboot, it is likely that your vmnet and vmmon devices will become unavailable. Because those devices are now unavailable, you have to manually run the vmware-config.pl to rebuild them into the existing /dev tree.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[UPDATE: 9/29/2004]&lt;/strong> This is total hogwash, see &lt;a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2003-09-29-its-alive-gentoo-and-t23.html %}">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dammit- Gentoo on T23 continued</title><link>/2003/09/21/dammit-gentoo-on-t23-continued.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2003/09/21/dammit-gentoo-on-t23-continued.html</guid><description>&lt;p>So everything was working flawlessly, and I had to switch over into Mandrake to get something, and when I rebooted to Gentoo again, chaos reigned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, not quite chaos, but several modules were refusing to load, with lots of scary messages about IRQ settings and other hogwash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gentoo on a T23</title><link>/2003/09/19/gentoo-on-a-t23.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2003/09/19/gentoo-on-a-t23.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Audio: &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/audio.htm">Intel i810&lt;/a>,&lt;br />
