<p>Ebullient is one of my favorite words, and if you know me at all, you'll know it's apropos. </p>

<p>I've frequently used &#8216;ebullient' as my <span class="caps">IRC</span> nick, and as women are (unfortunately still) not very common in open source <span class="caps">IRC</span> chat rooms, I was amused when someone referenced me as "eh-bull-i-ain't". Also, apropos. </p>

<h2>What's up with the icons?</h2>

<p>The little tiny moon is a favicon I remember slaving over with MS Paint or some ridiculous thing
back in the stone ages. I think I used it on scrappy websites that I made here and
there, they were definitely present and accounted for in the
<a href="/images/looks/yellow.diamonds.png">2006 yellow diamond phase</a>. Just looking
at that makes me feel silly and helps me rememeber how invested I was in learning
and trying out .. everything .. when all of this was new. That's why I keep the icons
around.</p>
