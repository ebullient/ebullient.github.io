<p><strong>Update: Sept 20, 2003</strong></p>

<p>First weird thing, I&#8217;m dual booting this machine right now, between my previous Mandrake install, and this new-fangled gentoo thing. And the System.Map generated by the gentoo system led to <span class="caps">REALLY</span> odd video behavior when I later went to build either version.. (now that I think about it, that was with the r6 kernel &#8211; should try the new System.map generated by the r7 kernel..) .. I relinked to the System.map used by Mandrake, and everything was happy &#8211; for either kernel.. whatever.</p>

<p>Found <a href="http://ghost.hn.org/~clesiuk/SonyVaio/#003">this link</a> &#8211; while it&#8217;s for a Sony Vaio, it&#8217;s also for the exact same intel do-everything chip that I&#8217;ve got in my T23.  Some of the pieces,  notably the <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> and <span class="caps">APM</span> stuff, doesn&#8217;t apply to the T23.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.patoche.org/alone/info/t23.html">this link for a T23 and Debian</a> which was the most helpful (<span class="caps">KISS</span> rule does seem to apply in this case).</p>

<p>**GAH!!!! *** I got network working, and I&#8217;ve no idea how. </p>

<p>I enabled <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> and Cardbus support in the kernel,  made <span class="caps">APM</span> a module, enabled <span class="caps">ACPI</span>, made sure the EEPRO100 and E100 drivers were built as modules, along with some of the Wireless <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> drivers (I have an Orinoco Wireless <span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> card).</p>

<p>Also updated sys-apps/baselayout, and some other things from the CD version, perhaps some of those updates helped&#8230;</p>
