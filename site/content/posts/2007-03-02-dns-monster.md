<p>So. For a few reasons, I have been moving my websites and domains off to <a href="http://www.hostmonster.com/hosting-features.htm">hostmonster</a>: a) free transfer + renewal; b) registerfly has been <a href="http://warning-about-registerfly.com/">sucking</a>, and some of my domains got caught in the <a href="http://registerflies.com/enom-help-with-registerfly-problems.html">registerfly/enom.com fiasco</a>, and I really just want to get them the hell out, c) hostmonster has ssh, php, mysql, ruby on rails - pretty much anything I ever wanted to tinker with, d) I can stick however many domains on my account that I want to. </p>

<p>The downside: CPanel, and DNS manipulation. I am used to having my hands right on the DNS records - with CPanel, not only can I not touch the records, but in certain cases, they have rules (either self imposed or imposed by CPanel's Web Host Manager thing) that just plain prevent me from doing what I want. I hate not being able to do what I want. (whine whine whine).</p>

<p>But look what I found: <a href="http://editdns.net/">EditDNS.net</a> - A DNS provider of free web hosting and a bunch of other goodies. They thrive on donations of course, but still... worth a try, I think.</p>
