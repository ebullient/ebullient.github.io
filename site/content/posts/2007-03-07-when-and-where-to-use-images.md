<p>I just read/skimmed <a href="http://24ways.org/2005/naughty-or-nice-css-background-images">Naughty or Nice? CSS Background Images</a> <span class="attribute">[<a href="http://24ways.org/">http://24ways.org/</a>]</span>. Now this is an old post (2005), and I don't remember how I stumbled on it, but the post makes a good point - don't stick in CSS what should be delivered via content. </p>

<p>I always try (with mixed success, I admit - it depends on how much control I have) to load my pages in lynx or some other text based browser to make sure I can still get around.  I increasingly find sites that are not navigable sans full-graphical-browser tricks.</p>
