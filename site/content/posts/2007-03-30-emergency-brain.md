<p>Thank goodness I have a functioning emergency brain. I've never needed to know that I even had one, much less whether or not it worked, until the unfortunate events of the past few weeks unfolded. </p>

<p>My Dad was in a very unfortunate accident at work. Rather than bandy on about it here, I'll send you to <a href="http://mike.haaser.com">the site we've created to share the news</a> (my Dad has a rather large fan club.;) ).</p>
