title: Ejecting the CD when things are hosed...
---
{{< raw_html >}}
<p>So, in starting to set up bootcamp, I totally managed to f something up! (Yes, I can even break a Mac). I tried the usual turn off / turn on the machine, and CRAP! the CD is still in the drive, and it HAS NO BUTTONS. Eject is totally software driven.</p>

<p>Thankfully, someone already <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/4363/ejecting_a_stuck_cd_in_mac_osx.html">took the time to list</a> all of the interesting things you should try to get your CD back. Number 3 did the trick.</p>

<blockquote><ol><li>The iTunes eject button</li>
<li>Disk Utility ...</li>
<li>Hold down mouse button at startup</li>
<li>Hold down C key at startup</li>
<li>Start up into Open Firmware ...</li>
<li>Start up in Target FireWire mode ...</li>
<li>Start up from another machine</li>
<li>Take your machine to an Apple Store</li></ol></blockquote>
