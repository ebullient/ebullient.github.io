title: Shell prompt crazy for Git Submodules
---
{{< raw_html >}}
<p>I've run a somewhat odd little script to generate my command prompt for years now, sets some colors, adds some indicators of what kind of shell I'm in (sudo or tmux/screen or ssh or.. ).</p>

<p>Given I now have to work with git and submodules, I've revised that to include information provided about git generated by this script: <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh</a></p>

<p>The difference is worth it, in understanding at a glance what is going on without typing <code>git status</code> or variant every two seconds. ;)</p>

<p>I've also been using some very useful aliases to make working with submodules sane, as documented here: <a href="https://book.gameontext.org/walkthroughs/git.html">Game On! Advanced Adventures / Git Submodules</a></p>
