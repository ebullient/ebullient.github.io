title: 'SpringOne 2017: Lightning talk on the Mainstage'
---
I will absolutely confess that it was daunting to start with, but that once I was out on the stage, everything was fine.

I will also confess to ad nauseum rehearsal. To reciting what I had to cram into two segments (one only 2 minutes long, and the other 2 minutes and 30 seconds) to every inanimate object in my hotel room: lamps, laptops, mirrors, showerheads, and I'm pretty sure my pillow while I was sleeping.

I didn't really wrap my head around what I wanted to say until the night before. Things just didn't fall into place before then. But hey, I lived! It was quite the experience.
