title: "Index 2018: What is a Cloud Native application, anyway?"
---
I gave a few talks at **Index** Developer Conference in San Francisco:

1) A Workshop! Game-On Text Adventure re-presented in lab form, with some lessons learned along the way.

2) Testing Cloud Native Applications

3) What is a Cloud Native Application, anyway? My first attempt at talking about what is going on with Cloud Native applications these days.

I did have a lovely interview with Kevin Allen beforehand:
