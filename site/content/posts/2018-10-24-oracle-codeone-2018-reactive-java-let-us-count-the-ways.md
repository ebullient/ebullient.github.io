Jabberwocky.

I can't make conference materials with a straight-face when left to my own devices, I just can't! 

Reactive paradigms can be confusing, so Ozzy and I put this workshop together.

First, we give an overview of reactive operators.
Using the Jabberwocky as input, we present participants with problems to solve.

First with RxJava, then with Spring WebFlux, and finally with Akka.

It was fun. ;)
