[Spring and the Mystery of the Polyglot Stack](https://devnexus.com/archive/devnexus2019/presentations/3833/)

> Modern Cloud Native applications are not composed of a single language, or runtime. There are often local standards and requirements for individual services, intended to allow the application as a whole to be properly managed, and secure. In this talk, Erin and Ozzy will discuss what it means to be a Spring application in a polyglot environment, with a focus on interoperable security, logging, metrics, and including a brief boat trip to view the architectural considerations for a Spring Cloud application on Kubernetes.

This session has its root in some work Ozzy and I did with one of our customers.
