This was one of those sessions that did not go right.

The speaker before ran over, and there were two of us. We didn't have time to get our microphones set up right. So switching between speakers, and between slides and demo was awkward at best. 

It was no fun. 

As this was a revisitation of our DevNexus talk, we knew it could work.. it just didn't.
