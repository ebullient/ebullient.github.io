> Understanding application behavior is important in any environment. The most efficient way to observe application behavior relies on metrics, key/value pairs of numerical data. This session will compare the capabilities of libraries like Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, and MicroProfile metrics. Weâ€™ll also explore how gathered data can be used to observe and understand application behavior in order to determine what should be measured.
