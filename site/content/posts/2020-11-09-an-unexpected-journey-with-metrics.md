title: 'D&D and Metrics: an unexpected journey'
---

I was asked, based solely on the abstract for my 2020 DevNexus talk, if I would be interested in writing an article on the topic. I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of **Java Magazin**, with "Dungeons & Dragons" as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.

The English version was first published at **JAXenter** as "Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&D".

I hope you enjoy it.
