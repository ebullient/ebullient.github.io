title: 'D&D and Metrics: an unexpected journey'
---

I was asked, based solely on the abstract for my 2020 DevNexus talk, if I would be interested in writing an article on the topic. I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of [Java Magazin](https://kiosk.entwickler.de/java-magazin/java-magazin-9-2020/dungeons-dragons/), with "Dungeons and Dragons" as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.

The English version has also now been published at [JaxEnter](https://jaxenter.com/metrics-dnd-173311.html), "Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&D".

I hope you enjoy it.
