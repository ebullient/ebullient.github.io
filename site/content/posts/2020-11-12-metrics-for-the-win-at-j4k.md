> Understanding application behavior is important in any environment. When thinking about metrics in the context of observable distributed systems, most associate application or service-level metrics with memory usage or throughput, but what else can you understand about your application using metrics? This session will explore data and insights gathered from domain-specific metrics using the Micrometer metrics library in both a Spring Boot and Quarkus application. It will also compare the capabilities of MicroProfile Metrics and the OpenTelemetry Java library.
