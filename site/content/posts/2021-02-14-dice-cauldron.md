title: DIY dice cauldron
---

Not alot of description around this one. Let's just say it's .. crochet engineering? I don't know. I was practicing crocheting circles as the base for baskets, and the pattern I was following, if you held it up to the light, had this nice convenient kind of spiral place where you could totally add a chain...

And things kind of grew from there.
