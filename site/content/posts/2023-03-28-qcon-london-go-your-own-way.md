Technically, the talk title was a lot longer, "You Can Go Your Own Way: Navigating Your Own Career Path"

I have never done a soft-skills, career development talk before. It was a unique experience. Being vulnerable and somewhat uncomfortable, sharing your story, dealing with imposter syndrome (why would anyone want to hear this?)... It was all of those things. Connecting with people and sharing experiences was totally worth it.
