What a blast! 

Sitting down with [Kadi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadi-grigg) and [Theresa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmammarella/) was a riot. Being with some of my long-time career besties ([Emily Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyfhjiang/), [Mary Grygleski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-grygleski/), and [Holly Cummins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-k-cummins/)) made it even better.

It felt like a natural extension of my [QCon talk](2023-03-28-qcon-london-go-your-own-way.md), in some ways.
