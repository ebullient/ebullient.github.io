I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of Java Magazin, with &amp;ldquo;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.
The English version was first published at JAXenter as &amp;ldquo;Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo;.
I hope you enjoy it.
