&lt;p>I wanted to do a clean install: the drive had two partitions, one an old windows partition that we don't use anymore, and the other was full of crap from years of trying out apps and the migration from Snow Leopard to Lion to Mountain Lion to Mavericks, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to make a full backup, so I could recover all of my settings and go scrounge around for files that I missed, etc., but I didn't want to clone a drive. I stumbled on these: &lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Can you see my plan? It worked very well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DNS-323: FFP on a stick, nightly rsync backup...</title><link>/2010/08/21/dns-323-ffp-on-stick-nightly-rsync-backup.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/08/21/dns-323-ffp-on-stick-nightly-rsync-backup.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a lot of things working well, gathered from a lot of resources. I tweaked some scripts to make them work better:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I created an /ffp/&lt;hostname> directory for my personal scripts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have an rsync script that mirrors the ffp installation on the USB stick (/mnt/usb/ffp) to the primary hard drive (/mnt/HD_a2). This means I only have to maintain the USB-copy, but if the USB is not available, I'll still have working stuff on the regular drive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have a few (small) scripts that I use for cron jobs, rather than putting it all directly into the cron task: has the advantage of being able to use logger to add syslog messages.&lt;/li>

Now that we don't record TV shows anymore, having that box on all the time is just a power drain. So: the goal is a DNS-323 with all of our files (photos, music, finance stuff, some movies, etc.) onto the first volume of that drive, and then using an rsync shadow with hardlinks to do nightly backups to the second drive. Some RAID configurations have been reported as less than stable, and using a mirror configuration requires both drives to be active: a nightly rsync backup will do.
