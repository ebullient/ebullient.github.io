This is an evolution of pockets (as referenced in a previous post) to explore what Camel can do for you, as you move beyond the simple requirements of a REST application.

While my ultimate goal is to do pretty much anything other than REST, I still have this nice shiny svelte front-end that needs to pull some things from the co-resident Quarkus app. I could, of course, provide that information in &amp;ldquo;the usual way&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m exploring Camel here, which means I should try doing it that way, instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Quarkus and Camel together is a bit of a brain-bender, as you&amp;rsquo;re overlapping two environments that are totally independent and overlapping, but it does work, and I can see some glimmers of why, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve grown up thinking about things as RestTemplates or JAX-RS resources, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; very different.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
