I wanted to change a few things the second time around, to see if I could get farther along with the application, but I was stymied again! No one texted me this time. Instead, my ipad and laptop fought with the projector over screen resolution.

See that blank screen behind @ebullientworks? Apparently her laptop doesn’t like the #DevoxxUK AV, but she’s rolling with it. It reminds me of @ixchelruiz’s virtuoso projection-free talk at Voxxed Milan, when 3 adapters let her down. pic.twitter.com/1FHYOGs6Gs

I have two recorded versions, but few charts, as this one was mostly code.
My daughter figured out how to text me in the middle of it. The notifications appeared on my ipad, so I could see them while the audience couldn&amp;rsquo;t, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to know if you would have been able to keep a straight face as the notifications arrived: &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
