This is an evolution of pockets (as referenced in a previous post) to explore what Camel can do for you, as you move beyond the simple requirements of a REST application.

There were some helpful articles out in the etherverse for how to do that, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing what did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to use my SSH key to sign my commits. I only commit code from a few places, and I already use SSH for github access, so this seemed the least invasive approach to attempt. That said, I use specific keys for github, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t use the ssh-agent, which means a few things functioned a little differently than most of the walkthroughs showed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devoxx UK 2022: Take a walk on the cient side</title><link>/2022/05/18/pockets-command-line-apps-at-devoxx-uk.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/05/18/pockets-command-line-apps-at-devoxx-uk.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I spoke about creating command line applications at DevNexus in May. I wanted to change a few things the second time around, to see if I could get farther along with the application, but I was stymied again! No one texted me this time. Instead, my ipad and laptop fought with the projector over screen resolution.&lt;/p>

I have two recorded versions, but few charts, as this one was mostly code.
My daughter figured out how to text me in the middle of it. The notifications appeared on my ipad, so I could see them while the audience couldn&amp;rsquo;t, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to know if you would have been able to keep a straight face as the notifications arrived: &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
The subject of the talk is a little command line application called &amp;ldquo;Pockets&amp;rdquo;, and it lives here: https://github.com/ebullient/pockets-cli</description></item><item><title>Quarkus Insights #57 (guest): Quarkus CLI</title><link>/2021/06/14/qi-new-quarkus-cli.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/06/14/qi-new-quarkus-cli.html</guid><description>A video in which live coding happens, and I don&amp;rsquo;t mess up too badly.</description></item></channel></rss>
