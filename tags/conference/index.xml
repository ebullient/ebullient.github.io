&lt;p>Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from a friend, these two things collided in the talk, too. Which lightened the mental load (or at least reduced the amount of full stack swapping going on).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is a Cloud Native Application, anyway? My first attempt at talking about what is going on with Cloud Native applications these days.&lt;/p>

I will also confess to ad nauseum rehearsal. To reciting what I had to cram into two segments (one only 2 minutes long, and the other 2 minutes and 30 seconds) to every inanimate object in my hotel room: lamps, laptops, mirrors, showerheads, and I'm pretty sure my pillow while I was sleeping.
I didn't really wrap my head around what I wanted to say until the night before. Things just didn't fall into place before then. But hey, I lived! It was quite the experience.
