Way back in the beginning was Movable Type (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was still a thing), followed by PHP-based CMS like Textpattern and Nucleus CMS, and then a brief flirtation with Blogger (someone made me do it). I have somehow avoided ever having to maintain templates for WordPress (?!). These systems all come back to some pretty basic concepts around templating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one snag was loathing having to do anything with ruby. I have never had anything but grief and pain installing ruby anywhere. But hey! We have docker now! Put it in a container and forget about it. WOOT!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docker script for AnyConnect on OSX</title><link>/2015/08/25/docker-script-for-anyconnect-on-osx.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/08/25/docker-script-for-anyconnect-on-osx.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I am queen of laziness, and I have to use AnyConnect, and that screws with Docker, and then I have to go looking to remember the magic incantation to get things right...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who has time for that? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a script that wraps the whole thing up and reminds me what I should do when it doesn't work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of: &lt;br />
&lt;code>&amp;gt; docker-machine env default&lt;/code>&lt;br />
I do this instead, and the script does the rest: &lt;br />
&lt;code>&amp;gt; . dockerEnv&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crib notes: Docker on OSX</title><link>/2015/03/31/crib-notes-docker-on-osx.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/31/crib-notes-docker-on-osx.html</guid><description> Of course I'm messing with Docker (isn't everyone)? But as most people using OS X are discovering, there are some hiccups. Here are some notes for myself (and perhaps for others) about what is required to make docker work well on OS X: How to Use Docker on OS X: The Missing Guide Most helpful (and a simultaneous &amp;#8216;duh' moment) was his reminder: boot2docker is the host image for docker on OS X, so when docker maps ports, it maps them to boot2docker, and not to OS X itself. So there are some extra things that need to be done to make that work. He has lots of useful suggestions. I also use AnyConnect, which introduces it's own fun, as it likes to rewrite the routing table for giggles. I am thankfully not the only one with this problem. So there were good things to be gleaned here, too.</description></item></channel></rss>
