&lt;p>Who has time for that? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a script that wraps the whole thing up and reminds me what I should do when it doesn't work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of: &lt;br />
&lt;code>&amp;gt; docker-machine env default&lt;/code>&lt;br />
I do this instead, and the script does the rest: &lt;br />
&lt;code>&amp;gt; . dockerEnv&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crib notes: Docker on OSX</title><link>/2015/03/31/crib-notes-docker-on-osx.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/03/31/crib-notes-docker-on-osx.html</guid><description> Of course I'm messing with Docker (isn't everyone)? But as most people using OS X are discovering, there are some hiccups. Here are some notes for myself (and perhaps for others) about what is required to make docker work well on OS X: How to Use Docker on OS X: The Missing Guide Most helpful (and a simultaneous &amp;#8216;duh' moment) was his reminder: boot2docker is the host image for docker on OS X, so when docker maps ports, it maps them to boot2docker, and not to OS X itself. So there are some extra things that need to be done to make that work. He has lots of useful suggestions. I also use AnyConnect, which introduces it's own fun, as it likes to rewrite the routing table for giggles. I am thankfully not the only one with this problem. So there were good things to be gleaned here, too.</description></item><item><title>Updating to Yosemite: clean install with a clever backup</title><link>/2014/12/30/updating-to-yosemite-clean-install-with-a-clever-backup.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/12/30/updating-to-yosemite-clean-install-with-a-clever-backup.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I upgraded my iMac (which is aging, sadly) to Yosemite while taking a break from work. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to do a clean install: the drive had two partitions, one an old windows partition that we don't use anymore, and the other was full of crap from years of trying out apps and the migration from Snow Leopard to Lion to Mountain Lion to Mavericks, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to make a full backup, so I could recover all of my settings and go scrounge around for files that I missed, etc., but I didn't want to clone a drive. I stumbled on these: &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Can you see my plan?

(Yes, I can even break a Mac). I tried the usual turn off / turn on the machine, and CRAP! the CD is still in the drive, and it HAS NO BUTTONS. Eject is totally software driven.
Thankfully, someone already took the time to list all of the interesting things you should try to get your CD back. Number 3 did the trick.
The iTunes eject button Disk Utility ... Hold down mouse button at startup Hold down C key at startup Start up into Open Firmware ... Start up in Target FireWire mode ... Start up from another machine Take your machine to an Apple Store</description></item><item><title>Happy Solstice!</title><link>/2007/12/21/happy-solstice.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2007/12/21/happy-solstice.html</guid><description>The longest night of the year has come.. the shortest day of the year is done, and I... well.
So there was this box. It got shipped here a little while ago. It's large, squarish, and only about a foot and a half deep. It's been sitting in the dining room by the skimpily ornamented Norfolk pine and the tiny Meyer lemon tree (which is just beside itself with lemons on the make, but that's another story).
Chris was very careful that I not see anything about it (I also was honest and didn't go looking.. I mean, what's the fun of that?), but he has asked me to guess what it was.. "A spare tire", "A wall-hanging jewelry closet", "A mirror"... The closest I could come (and I didn't think I had a chance in hell of it being so) was a big beautiful LCD monitor to replace the monstrosity on my desk downstairs.
And Lo! it was a big beautiful LCD monitor.. complete with a bluetooth wireless keyboard and mouse. My husband, that wonderful man, gifted me an iMac.
Yesss..</description></item></channel></rss>
