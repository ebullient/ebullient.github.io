I've run into a new issue loading the dri drivers: AIGLX error: dlopen of /usr/lib/dri/fglrx_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/dri/fglrx_dri.so: undefined symbol: __glXFindDRIScreen). Moving to the latest ati driver seemed to fix that (8.37.6-r1).
ATI Linux drivers for debian has great information around how to configure X11 to work with the proprietary ati drivers.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Local APIC is required for USB to function properly, but it borks all over suspend/poweroff processing. There is a simple enough referenced patch to make it behave&amp;#8230;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This was happening to me, and while that's a lindows tutorial, it hit the nail on the head:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>Because devfs rebuilds the /dev tree at each reboot, it is likely that your vmnet and vmmon devices will become unavailable. Because those devices are now unavailable, you have to manually run the vmware-config.pl to rebuild them into the existing /dev tree.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
