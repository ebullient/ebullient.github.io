Each track had an ad-hoc meeting room that you could join after the session, which was really cool. It was nice to be able to speak with people that watched my talk directly. It brought back a bit of the in-person conference feel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of &lt;em>course&lt;/em> the first question was &amp;ldquo;Which edition of D&amp;amp;D?&amp;rdquo; (5e), what I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was the next question, &amp;ldquo;Is that the new Sesame Street Lego set?&amp;rdquo; (yes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recording will be generally available in August of 2022!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Know your app: Add metrics to Java with Micrometer</title><link>/2021/06/10/devnation-know-your-app.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/06/10/devnation-know-your-app.html</guid><description>&lt;div class="embed video-player">

&lt;p>I quite like this one, to be honest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from a friend, these two things collided in the talk, too. Which lightened the mental load (or at least reduced the amount of full stack swapping going on).&lt;/p>
