I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of Java Magazin, with &amp;ldquo;Dungeons and Dragons&amp;rdquo; as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.
The English version has also now been published at JaxEnter, &amp;ldquo;Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo;.
I hope you enjoy it.</description></item><item><title>Metrics for the win! at JConf</title><link>/2020/10/12/metrics-for-the-win-at-jconf.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/12/metrics-for-the-win-at-jconf.html</guid><description>A fully online recorded talk, sliding in at just 30 minutes, for JConf in the fall of 2020.</description></item><item><title>Monsters and Metrics at SpringOne 2019</title><link>/2019/10/23/springone-monsters-metrics.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/10/23/springone-monsters-metrics.html</guid><description>Two things collided in my brain this year ahead of SpringOne: Preparing a new talk from scratch covering the Micrometer (and the related Spring implementation), and learning everything I needed to know to be a Dungeon Master for my 10-year-old son and his friends.
Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from a friend, these two things collided in the talk, too. Which lightened the mental load (or at least reduced the amount of full stack swapping going on).
