I agreed. The resulting article was published in Germina, in the September 2020 issue of Java Magazin, with &amp;ldquo;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; as the title. I have a lovely hard-copy in my office.
The English version was first published at JAXenter as &amp;ldquo;Monsters in combat: exploring application metrics with D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo;.
I hope you enjoy it.

&lt;p>Thanks to a brilliant suggestion from a friend, these two things collided in the talk, too. Which lightened the mental load (or at least reduced the amount of full stack swapping going on).&lt;/p>

The speaker before ran over, and there were two of us. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to get our microphones set up right. So switching between speakers, and between slides and demo was awkward at best.
It was no fun.
As this was a revisitation of our DevNexus talk, we knew it could work.. it just didn&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>DevNexus 2019: Spring and the Mystery of the Polyglot Stack</title><link>/2019/02/18/spring-and-the-mystery-of-the-polyglot-stack.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/02/18/spring-and-the-mystery-of-the-polyglot-stack.html</guid><description>Spring and the Mystery of the Polyglot Stack
Modern Cloud Native applications are not composed of a single language, or runtime. There are often local standards and requirements for individual services, intended to allow the application as a whole to be properly managed, and secure. In this talk, Erin and Ozzy will discuss what it means to be a Spring application in a polyglot environment, with a focus on interoperable security, logging, metrics, and including a brief boat trip to view the architectural considerations for a Spring Cloud application on Kubernetes.
This session has its root in some work Ozzy and I did with one of our customers.</description></item></channel></rss>
