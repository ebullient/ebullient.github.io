I do (still) use FightClub5 as a player, and to manage what my players have to deal with / look at for our campaigns. &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian&lt;/a> has started to take over as campaign manager, because encounters are created/set up/and tracked in Roll20.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working with &lt;a href="https://github.com/kinkofer/FightClub5eXML/">https://github.com/kinkofer/FightClub5eXML/&lt;/a> to stitch together the sources I want for FightClub5 (the source for these XML files in turn is &lt;a href="https://5e.tools/,">https://5e.tools/,&lt;/a> which is pretty good, too).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing lead to another, and time passed, and I worked on the Quarkus CLI, and then I had the idea to write my own client that could do all of the steps required (validate the xml, merge/combine/filter with XSLT) and additionally convert the output into markdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Happy!&lt;/p>
