While my ultimate goal is to do pretty much anything other than REST, I still have this nice shiny svelte front-end that needs to pull some things from the co-resident Quarkus app. I could, of course, provide that information in &amp;ldquo;the usual way&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m exploring Camel here, which means I should try doing it that way, instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Quarkus and Camel together is a bit of a brain-bender, as you&amp;rsquo;re overlapping two environments that are totally independent and overlapping, but it does work, and I can see some glimmers of why, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve grown up thinking about things as RestTemplates or JAX-RS resources, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; very different.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iterative development with Quarkus and Svelte, care of Quinoa</title><link>/2023/02/07/iterative-development-quarkus-svelte-quinoa.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2023/02/07/iterative-development-quarkus-svelte-quinoa.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Another conference is coming up, and I&amp;rsquo;m writing another ridiculous frankenstein app for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this revision, I am going to add a local-only Web UI for a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This app is still mostly command-line driven, but some configuration options are awkward to set as arguments, and manually editing a config file is &amp;hellip; meh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any serious front-end UI work in a really long time. The UI for &lt;a href="https://github.com/gameontext/gameon-webapp">Game On! Text adventure&lt;/a> is overdue for an overhaul, it&amp;rsquo;s an Angular 1 app. I know, I know. Don&amp;rsquo;t judge me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Between one thing and another, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing more TypeScript alongside my Java and because of some collaboration on plugins for &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian.md&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been bumping up against Svelte. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this little project to actually figure out how Svelte works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project will then have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus&lt;/a> as the main CLI driver that will sometimes wait around for awhile while you fuss around with a Web UI.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte&lt;/a> to create a UI that feels nice to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven&lt;/a> for building Java things&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node&lt;/a> + &lt;a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite&lt;/a> for TypeScript tooling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On the surface, the above sounds like a big mess, right? I&amp;rsquo;m installing double the tools, having to do this build in two steps, and then do the fancy dance to get the Node stuff in the right place in the Java stuff, and deal with making native images happy, and&amp;hellip; &lt;em>gross&lt;/em> ðŸ¤¢.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ia3andy">Andy Damevin&lt;/a> has already come to provide the rescue I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I would need. He created the &lt;a href="https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-quinoa/dev/index.html">Quinoa extension&lt;/a>, and I am a fan! ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Quinoa extension manages building and packaging the embedded Web UI with its preferred tools. So the outer Maven build can carry on doing its thing, and the Quinoa extension will invoke the appropriate node scripts to build and package the Web UI, and tuck them in the right place for serving with an uber jar or native binary. Not only that, but it integrates Quarkus dev mode with the web framework&amp;rsquo;s live coding support, which means you just keep coding and the entire web app evolves as you go. Holy cow, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devoxx UK 2022: Take a walk on the cient side</title><link>/2022/05/18/pockets-command-line-apps-at-devoxx-uk.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/05/18/pockets-command-line-apps-at-devoxx-uk.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I spoke about creating command line applications at DevNexus in May.

Instead, my ipad and laptop fought with the projector over screen resolution.&lt;/p>

I have two recorded versions, but few charts, as this one was mostly code.
My daughter figured out how to text me in the middle of it. The notifications appeared on my ipad, so I could see them while the audience couldn&amp;rsquo;t, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to know if you would have been able to keep a straight face as the notifications arrived: &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;mom&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
The subject of the talk is a little command line application called &amp;ldquo;Pockets&amp;rdquo;, and it lives here: https://github.com/ebullient/pockets-cli</description></item><item><title>Quarkus Insights #81 (host): Morphia and MongoDB object-document mapping</title><link>/2022/02/21/qi-morphia-and-mongodb.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/02/21/qi-morphia-and-mongodb.html</guid><description>Justin Lee drops by to discuss MongoDB object-document mapping with the Quarkus Morphia extension.
