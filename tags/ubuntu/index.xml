Somehow, with some update, I managed to screw nvidia up properly, and then in fixing that, I broke symantec antivirus, too. Part of it was that the 14.04 ubuntu headers have moved up, but the kernel was still at an older version, which made dkms pissy, and .. well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bootstrapping ubuntu server on an external drive</title><link>/2014/08/29/ubuntu-bootstrap.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/08/29/ubuntu-bootstrap.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a new 2TB drive that I am going to use to replace a drive on a much used server that is currently running gentoo (which I have increasingly less time to tend). So. I have this new drive in an external enclosure, and I want to bootstrap it with the new OS without having to do that &amp;#8220;go reboot your computer with a &lt;span class="caps">USB&lt;/span> key thing&amp;#8221;. I want my OS on the disk, I want to test that all the services can be coerced to behave the way I need them to behave, and I want to do all this with a minimum of fuss and gymnastics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>lubuntu 11.04 on a thinkpad w520</title><link>/2011/10/11/lubuntu-1104-on-thinkpad-w520.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2011/10/11/lubuntu-1104-on-thinkpad-w520.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Getting ready to do some travelling for work (Hooray for people that &lt;a href="http://wasdev.net">love our alpha&lt;/a>!), and figured I should move things from my much beloved purple Dell (which is the quadcore I got when I needed one), to the Lenovo Thinkpad W520 that is my official business issued laptop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ubuntu 10.10: sound crackling (especially pidgin), and fluxbox crashes</title><link>/2010/10/26/ubuntu-1010-sound-crackling-especially-pidgin-and-fluxbox-crashes.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2010/10/26/ubuntu-1010-sound-crackling-especially-pidgin-and-fluxbox-crashes.html</guid><description> I think I should have stayed w/ 10.04. The audio was cracking: known issue with a fix. After applying that, pidgin alert sounds were still crackling. I had to go into pidgin prefs and change the method from Automatic to ALSA. The real bugger is that fluxbox keeps crashing. I have gnome running (session manager, session prefs, etc.), but am using fluxbox as a window manager. I'm sorry.. all the compiz stuff looks cool, but once you start stacking/grouping windows, it's really hard to get used to a window manager that won't do it. I had fluxbox working as the window manager with Lucid (10.04) without issue, but for some reason, flux crashes a _lot_ with 10.10. Pain. (it's thankfully easy to restart flux without having to log out/in.. but still).</description></item></channel></rss>
