&lt;p>Who has time for that? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a script that wraps the whole thing up and reminds me what I should do when it doesn't work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of: &lt;br />
&lt;code>&amp;gt; docker-machine env default&lt;/code>&lt;br />
I do this instead, and the script does the rest: &lt;br />

But as most people using OS X are discovering, there are some hiccups. Here are some notes for myself (and perhaps for others) about what is required to make docker work well on OS X: How to Use Docker on OS X: The Missing Guide Most helpful (and a simultaneous &amp;#8216;duh' moment) was his reminder: boot2docker is the host image for docker on OS X, so when docker maps ports, it maps them to boot2docker, and not to OS X itself. So there are some extra things that need to be done to make that work. He has lots of useful suggestions. I also use AnyConnect, which introduces it's own fun, as it likes to rewrite the routing table for giggles. I am thankfully not the only one with this problem. So there were good things to be gleaned here, too.</description></item></channel></rss>
